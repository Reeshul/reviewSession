- Improve on **agile methodology** - include an inputs/outputs table that you can present to clients and consider making up some inputs yourself. This may be able to be used later for test cases.

- Consider _breadth testing_ (as opposed to depth testing) as that may be easier to progress (eg. single green, then single amber, then single red)

- Imrpove on the information gathering process. Things like whether the inputs are cases sensitive should be asked in the beginning.

- A separate test should've been done to test for case sensitivity

- Fourth test was unnecessary as that was already covered in the fifth (or vice versa)
